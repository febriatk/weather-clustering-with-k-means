# WEATHER CLUSTERING

This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm in Python to analyze weather patterns based on multidimensional variables, including temperature, humidity, rainfall, solar radiation, and wind speed. The dataset comprises daily weather observations from the Banyuwangi region during January 2022, with built-in visualizations provided to effectively showcase the clustering results. The analysis revealed dominant patterns associated with rainy weather conditions.


## Features
- K-Means Clustering implementation in Python
- Visualization of cluster with PCA

## Output
### Centroid Center
![{DED5AE5D-631C-4131-9CFF-A5AF6ADAEF86}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1209d07e-b534-4ace-bcf9-696ed0c4dd1c)

Based on the final results of centroid center, the data has been grouped into three clusters. The conclusions for each cluster are as follows:
- Cluster 1 : contains data representing cloudly weather
- Cluster 2 : contains data representing rainy weather
- Cluster 3 : contains data representing hot weather

### List of Data and Their Corresponding Clusters

### Data Count for Each Cluster

Based on the output, it is observed that most data fall into Cluster 2. This indicates that during Januari 2022, the Banyuwangi region predominantly rainy weather
